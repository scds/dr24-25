# Visualizing Your Research Impact

The ability to create effective visualizations of your research impact is a valuable skill when competing for grants, awards, and attention in a crowded research landscape.  In this workshop we will explore best practices for generating simple, eye-catching graphics to communicate your impact from a variety of perspectives (from citation rates to collaboration networks to media attention).

Attendees will learn how to: 
1. Generate ready-made impact visualizations within a variety of bibliometric tools at McMaster. 
2. Utilize raw bibliometric data to create custom visualizations within a variety of tools (Excel, VosViewer, Datawrapper).
3. Effectively incorporate research impact visualizations into reports, grant applications, and award nominations.
