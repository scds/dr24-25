# Electronic Lab Notebooks

This beginner-level session introduces participants to Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELNs), covering common functions, ELN options, and key research considerations.  This workshop will provide guidance on selecting and implementing ELNs for both personal use and within research groups.

By the end of this workshop, participants will understand common features and functions of ELNs as well as the key considerations and tradeoffs involved in ELN selection. Participants will be better equipped to evaluate ELN options and select and implement ELNs to suite their unique research needs.
