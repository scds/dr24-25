# Visualizing Your Research Impact

The San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) establishes a holistic approach to understanding research impact and asserts its signatories’ commitment to responsible research assessment.  In this session, panelists will discuss DORA’s implications for researchers and administrators and provide recommendations for optimizing research impact reporting in a post-DORA world.  

Attendees will understand: 1) The key recommendations of DORA.  2) DORA’s implications for future funding opportunities and research impact reporting.  3) The resources available at McMaster to support researchers and administrators in their adherence to DORA principles.
